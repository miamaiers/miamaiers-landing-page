## 1. Project Overview

Mia Maiers, a Business Analytics and Information Systems junior at the University of Iowa, needs a "digital home" to establish a personal brand. While a resume lists tasks, this landing page solves the problem of demonstrating the bridge between technical capability and business communication. It provides a platform to showcase the "why" and "how" behind data projects to an established Iowa network.

The primary audience includes the President and Owner of Decker Concrete, where Mia will return as a full-time Business Analyst. Secondary audiences include Mia's established professional network in Iowa. These visitors are looking for evidence of technical proficiency, professional growth, and the ability to translate complex data into business value

## 2. Technical Standards

These rules apply to every file in this project without exception.

**Languages and versions:**

- HTML5 — use semantic elements throughout: `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`,
  `<article>`, `<footer>`, `<nav>`
- CSS3 — all styles must be written in `css/stylesheet.css`; no inline `style=""`
  attributes; no `<style>` tags in any HTML file
- HTML5 and CSS3 code must pass validation

**Folder structure:**

<pre>
/your-website-project (Root Folder)  
├── index.html  
├── /css  
│    └── stylesheet.css  
├── /js  
│    └── scripts.js  
├── /images  
│    └── headshot.jpg
</pre>

**Framework:**

- [Delete one of the following options:]
- No framework — vanilla CSS only
- Bootstrap 5.3 loaded via CDN in the `<head>` of `index.html`
- Tailwind CSS

**Architecture:**

- Static site — no JavaScript, no server-side code, no database, no back-end
- Single `index.html` file in the project root
- External stylesheet: `stylesheet.css` in the css folder and referenced by relative path
- All images stored in the `images/` subfolder and referenced by relative path
  (e.g., `src="images/photo.jpg"`) — never link to external image URLs
- Do not link to or embed my resume anywhere on the site

**Responsiveness:**

- Fully responsive at all screen widths from 320px and wider
- No horizontal scrolling on any viewport

**Accessibility — WCAG 2.2 Level AA (non-negotiable):**

- All `<img>` elements must have a descriptive `alt` attribute
- Color contrast ratio: minimum 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text
- Heading hierarchy must be logical: `<h1>` → `<h2>` → `<h3>`, no levels skipped
- All link text must be descriptive — no "click here", "read more", or bare URLs
- Page `<title>` element must be descriptive (not "Untitled" or "index")
- All interactive elements (links, buttons) must be keyboard navigable

**Compatibility:**

- Must render correctly on Chrome, Safari, and Firefox; must be mobile-responsive (works on screens 375px and wider)

## **Security:**

- Links to external sites should open in a new tab (`target="_blank"` with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`)

## 3. Design Standards

These visual rules apply to the entire site. Claude must follow them on every
build and every revision.

**Color palette:**

| Role                 | Hex Code        | Usage                                 |
| -------------------- | --------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Background           | [e.g., #f7f0ca] | Page background                       |
| Primary text         | [e.g., #000000] | Body copy, paragraphs                 |
| Accent               | [e.g., #f885fc] | Section headings, links, skill tags   |
| Secondary background | [e.g., #E9ECEF] | Section backgrounds, card backgrounds |

**OR:** Cream / black / white. Clean and modern, not flashy.

**Typography:**

- Heading font: [font name, e.g., Inter] — import from Google Fonts
- Body font: [font name, e.g., Inter]
- Body size: [e.g., 16px], line height: [e.g., 1.6]
- H1 (page name): [e.g., 1.5rem, bold]
- H2 (section headings): [e.g., 1.25rem, bold, accent color]

**Imagery:** Professional headshot only. No stock photos or clip art. No emojis.

**Layout:**

- Maximum content width: [e.g., 800px], centered on the page
- Navigation: [e.g., sticky top bar with anchor links to each section]
- Section spacing: [e.g., 60px top and bottom padding on each section]
- Single column on mobile, two-column on desktop for project cards. Generous whitespace.

**Component styles:**

_Profile photo:_

- Circular crop, 160px diameter, centered in the hero section

_Skill tags:_

- Rounded pill badges — accent color background with white text for
  technical skills; secondary background with dark text for professional skills

_Contact links:_

- Display as labeled icon badges opening in a new tab; include LinkedIn,
  GitHub, and email

_Navigation links:_

- Plain text links, accent color on hover, no underline by default

**Tone:**

- **Three words that describe the desired feel:** Professional, Modern, Data-driven, Minimal, not a creative portfolio

- **Writing tone:** First person, direct, and confident. Avoid buzzwords like 'passionate' or 'synergy.'

**Reference sites:**

- read.cv — for overall simplicity and whitespace
- brittanychiang.com — for section hierarchy (light background only,
  not dark mode)
